"""
<FILENAME> â€” Brief, one-sentence purpose of the file (e.g., Core logic for the FastMCP server).

A more detailed description of the module's responsibilities,
its primary functions, and what part of the larger project it handles.
It should explain the context and structure of the code within.

Usage:
  1. Ensure the virtual environment is active (pipenv shell).
  2. Run the server using the fastmcp CLI wrapper:
     $ pipenv run python server.py
  
Dependencies:
  - Requires the 'abc' library to be installed via Pipenv.
  
Note:
  This script handles environment setup and calls the app.run() method;
  all core business logic (Tools and Resources) resides in the 'src/' package.
